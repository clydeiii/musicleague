I ended up going with this one despite the fact that it is built around a fairly simple melody. That said the layering around it is excellent. Most of their songs build like this. This is my favorite of their compositions though. The interplay in the energetic sections in the end is especially dense and really appreciating the counter melodies took me 5-10 listens at least.
