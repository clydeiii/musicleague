I don't know how or when you lost your mind, but I would politely call the police and report it missing. So long and for what.

Warm song that in and of itself could help make bread rise given it's warm/comforting nature and ability to be on loop for hours. Very Norah Jones.

So there isn't a noticeable piano/organ....so I'm assuming the connection is to space??? But there is only 1 line that fits and it just isn't enough of a connection to be worth a point. It was some nice background music while I got some work done though. So my productivity thanks you....my points do not <3",6ea95b87a6e943f1994c0c7cf8be80f7

I guess it would've been great to get the connection to space as well...but beggars can't be choosers. 1 pt cause it fits the piano...but yeah these instrumentals aren't the vibe. ,6ea95b87a6e943f1994c0c7cf8be80f7
